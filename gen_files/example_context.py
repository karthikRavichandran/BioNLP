context1 = '''The purpose of the memorandum is to exchange information and expertise in the area of occupational safety and health. One product of this agreement is the development of documents to provide the scientific basis for establishing recommended occupational exposure limits. These limits will be developed separately by the two countries according to their different national policies. This document on the health effects of occupational exposure to acrylamide is the fourth product of that agreement. The document was written by Vlasta Molak, Ph.D., D.A.B.T. (DSDTT/NIOSH), and was reviewed by the Criteria Group and by DSDTT/NIOSH.# BACKGROUND\n\n# CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES\nAcrylamide is an odorless, white, crystalline solid used as a monomer or as a raw material in the production of polyacrylamides and other compounds. Chemical and physical properties of acrylamide are given in Table 1. Because most of the aciylamide monomer is produced and used as an aqueous solution, the physical properties of a 50% aqueous solution of acrylamide are also given (Table 2).'''
