The optimal duration of PEP is unknown; because 4 weeks of ZDV appeared protective (2 ), PEP should probably be administered for 4 weeks, if tolerated. 4. If the source patient or the patient's HIV status is unknown, initiating PEP should be decided on a case-by-case basis, based on the exposure risk and likelihood of HIV infection in known or possible source patients. If additional information becomes available, decisions about PEP can be modified. \u00b6 An HIV strain is more likely to be resistant to a specific antiretroviral agent if it is derived from a patient who has been exposed to the agent for a prolonged period of time (e.g., 6-12 months or longer). In general, resistance develops more readily in persons with more advanced HIV infection (e.g., CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of <200 cells/mm 3 ), reflecting the increasing rate of viral replication during later stages of the illness."}, {"Final_set": {"Chunk": "Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV should be considered in cases of occupational exposure to HIV, particularly through percutaneous injury. It's imperative to start PEP as soon as possible, ideally within hours of exposure, and it should be continued for 28 days. The standard PEP regimen includes antiretroviral medications such as zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir. Follow-up HIV testing is recommended at baseline and at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months post-exposure to ensure the absence of HIV infection.

The rationale for this choice is that postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is most effective when initiated within hours of exposure to HIV.
