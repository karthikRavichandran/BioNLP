The correct answer is B. The patient's prolonged exposure to DEHP likely led to increased lipid metabolism in peroxisomes and subsequent accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The breakdown of H2O2 by catalase is insufficient to prevent damage, thus leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species that damage cellular membranes and DNA. This cellular insult can cause dysplastic changes and the formation of lesions in the liver, contributing to tumorigenesis.", "option": "B"}, "actual_context": "The increased lipid metabolism in the peroxisomes may generate increased amounts of H^O^. Since catalase, the enzyme which catalyzes the breakdown of to water, is only slightly induced by DEHP the result w ill be an increased formation of oxygen radicals which may damage membranes and/or DNA (16).
