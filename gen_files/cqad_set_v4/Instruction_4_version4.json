Immunization against B virus strains of one lineage provides limited cross-protection against strains in the other lineage (25). Because of this and the difficulty of predicting which B virus lineage will predominate during a given season, inclusion of a second influenza B vaccine virus strain in seasonal influenza vaccines has been proposed. A recent analysis indicates that the impact of such a quadrivalent vaccine could result in a modest reduction in influenza-associated outcomes, depending upon adequate vaccine supply, coverage, effectiveness, and incidence of influenza associated with the two B lineages (26).\nIn February 2012, FDA approved a new seasonal quadrivalent LAIV, FluMist Quadrivalent (MedImmune). This vaccine currently is not anticipated to be available until the 2013-14 influenza season, at which time it is expected to replace the currently available seasonal trivalent FluMist formulation (Table ). Inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccines currently are in development. These vaccines will be addressed in the ACIP influenza statement as they are approved and become available commercially. - Respiratory distress (e.g., wheezing)?\n- Gastrointestinal (e.g., nausea/vomiting)?"}, {"Final_set": {"Chunk": "# Reported by\nLisa Grohskopf", "Clinical Scenario": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents after experiencing a seizure. The child has a history of frequent upper respiratory infections but has otherwise been healthy. During the assessment, the parents reveal that the boy had fallen and landed on his head during a recent soccer game. On examination, he appears drowsy but responsive, with no focal neurological deficits. The physician notes evidence of a possible head injury with mild tenderness over the scalp. A CT scan of the head is performed and shows a small, localized hemorrhage in the subdural space.", "Question": "What is the most likely cause of the subdural hematoma in this child?", "Choices": ["A: Non-accidental head trauma", "B: Coagulation disorder", "C: Acceleration-deceleration injury", "D: Minor head trauma associated with soccer"], "Answer": "D: Minor head trauma associated with soccer. The best answer is D. This scenario presents a child with a history of minor head trauma sustained during an activity (soccer), which is likely to have led to the development of a subdural hematoma. In children, subdural hematomas often result from falls or minor head injuries. While non-accidental trauma is a consideration in certain age groups, the context and history point more towards a sports-related injury. Furthermore, significant acceleration-deceleration injuries typically involve much greater forces than those seen in the described incident."}, "actual_context": "# Reported by\nLisa Grohskopf"}]
