Patients with chronic diseases reported that the most important factors in adherence to medications were incorporating medication into their daily routines, knowing that the medications work, believing that the benefits outweigh the risks, knowing how to manage side effects, and low out-of pocket costs. 111,112 When initiating a PrEP regimen, clinicians must educate", "question": "How do the motivations of individuals treated for HIV differ from those using PrEP?", "answer": "The motivations of persons being treated for HIV infection and persons trying to prevent HIV infection may differ."}, {"instruction": "**Instruction for Answering a Medical Question:**\n\n1.
