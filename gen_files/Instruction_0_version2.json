At the end of the study 2,148 individuals were deceased, and death certificates were obtained for 95%. The underlying cause of death was coded by a nosologist. Exposure estimates were developed for all jobs at each of the four plants using exposure data collected at each plant and information obtained from plant personnel who had knowledge of past jobs and processes. Exposure to acrylamide was defined as a cumulative exposure greater than 0.001 mg/m3-years, which is approximately equivalent to a 1-day exposure to an average concentration of 0.3 mg/m3. Data on smoking history were available for only a third of the cohort. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and internally standardized rate ratios were employed to estimate the risk.\nAccording to the authors, a particular strength of their study was the ability to detect a 25% increase in total cancer, a 50% increase in respiratory cancer, and a threefold increase in brain and other central nervous system cancers based on a two-tailed, 5% significance level with a power of 80%.", "question": "What percentage of the cohort had death certificates obtained for their analysis?", "answer": "Death certificates were obtained for 95% of the cohort."}, {"instruction": "**Instruction for Answering a Medical Question:**\n\n1. **Identify the Core Query**: Start by clearly understanding the medical question being asked.

Hashimoto and Aldridge  observed that after rats received a single i.v. dose o f UC acrylamide, the radioactivity in blood after 24 hr was entirely associated with red blood cells. Miller et al.  found that the concentration o f 14C in whole blood reached a plateau at 12% o f the total dose after 1 hr and remained constant throughout the time period examined (7 days). The binding to erythrocytes accounted for essentially all o f the remaining radioactivity in the w hole blood. In vitro studies showed that acrylamide was covalently bound to cysteine residues in protein and, on acidic hydrolysis, the adduct yielded a compound with chromatographic properties identified as S-( 2", "question": "What did in vitro studies reveal about acrylamide in relation to protein binding?", "answer": "In vitro studies revealed that acrylamide was covalently bound to cysteine residues in protein, resulting in an adduct that, upon acidic hydrolysis, yielded a compound with specific chromatographic properties."}, {"instruction": "**Instruction for Answering a Medical Question:**\n\n1. **Read the Question Carefully:** Ensure you understand what specific medical information is being asked.

Workers potentially exposed to acrylamide monomer are employed in acrylamide manufacturing and processing, grouting operations, and research and analytical laboratories.\nOnly the acrylamide monomer is toxic; polyacrylamide products are generally nontoxic. Acrylamide monomer may be neurotoxic, carcinogenic, genotoxic, and hazardous to reproduction. Recent studies confirm that acrylamide exposures cause cancer and reproductive effects in animals, but epidem iologic studies have not demonstrated these effects in humans. Key Words: Acrylamide, carcinogenicity, dermal exposures, grouting, neurotoxic effects, occupational exposure, polyacrylamide, reproductive effects.\n\n# APPENDIX. INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS FOR WORKPLACE EXPOSURES TO ACRYLAMIDE\nThis appendix lists occupational exposure lim its for airborne acrylamide in various countries (Table A -", "question": "What evidence exists regarding the carcinogenic and reproductive effects of acrylamide in humans?", "answer": "Epidemiologic studies have not demonstrated carcinogenic and reproductive effects of acrylamide in humans."}]
