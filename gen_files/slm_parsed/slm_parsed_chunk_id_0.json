The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) estimates that more than 10,000 U.S. workers were potentially exposed to acrylamide monomer during the period 1981-83, either in acrylamide manufacturing and processing or in grouting operations (particularly in sewer grouting)."}, {"reason": "Acrylamide is known to react with proteins through its vinyl group, leading to covalent modifications that can disrupt normal cellular functions, particularly in neurons, which may result in the symptoms observed in the factory worker, such as peripheral neuropathy.", "option": "C", "e_context": "Acrylamide is a small organic molecule that is very soluble in water and can react at both its amide group and its double-bond vinyl group.
