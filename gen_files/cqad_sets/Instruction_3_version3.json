On the other hand, the majority of transformation tests in the IPCS study (9) were positive for DEHP. Negative results were obtained with BALB/c-3T3 cells, while a study measuring the enhancement of v iral transformation of Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) cells, was considered to be inconclusive. Positive responses were obtained by four other investigators (9), using SHE cells, with doses of 1-300 |ig/ml (two different laboratories), embryonic mouse fibroblasts at 1000 ng/ml with S9 and 10 ng/ml without S9, or retrovirus-infected Fischer ra t embryo cells, at the highest dose tested, 2000 pg/ml. In a separate study (115) both DEHP (7500 mg/kg and 15000 mg/kg) and MEHP (375 mg/kg and 750 mg/kg) induced morphological transformation, as well as chromosomal aberrations, in SHE cells after transplacental administration."}, {"Final_set": {"Context": "Recent studies indicate that di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a common plasticizer, has primarily negative results in genotoxicity assays, signifying it may not act directly as a genotoxic agent in vitro.

This conclusion aligns with the mainly negative results obtained from mutagenicity testing and measures of DNA damage, indicating that DEHP and its metabolites do not directly interact with or damage DNA in most conditions examined.

The results indicate that DEHP is not a direct acting genotoxic agent in vitro. With few exceptions mutagenicity studies both in bacteria and eucaryotic cells have been negative and essentially no positive response has been obtained in assays measuring DNAdamage. This is also consistent with results obtained in DNA-binding studies, which have been unable to detect any covalent binding of DEHP or its metabolites to DNA. Tests measuring chromosomal abberations and SCE have also largely been negative. However, MEHP has been found to be a clastogen in vitro but i t has been argued that this effect could be related to the surface active properties of MEHP. A few in vivo assays, measuring the induction of micronuclei, UDS or strand breaks in DNA, have also been performed with negative results. Neither could any mutagenic metabolites be detected in the urine from DEHP treated rats, using a Salmonella assay. In contradiction to these negative results, a few in vitro assays measuring aneuploidy have mainly been positive.

However, this effect is not observed in rats, where DEHP appears to inhibit or regress such foci over an extended feeding period.

The correct answer is B. This is because while DEHP acts as a promoter in mouse studies, the specific mechanism through which this promotion occurs in mice has not been established.

DEHP has therefore been tested in several initiation/promotion experiments in rats and mice where the end point has been the number and/or volume of foci of altered liver cells. As expected, DEHP lacks in itiatin g activity in these experiments (78,120). DEHP is a probable promoter of such foci in the mouse liver and accordingly a possible tumor promoter in the mouse (120). In the ra t, however, DEHP does not promote altered foci during two years of feeding ( 78) and even seems to accelerate the regression or inhibit the appearance of some kinds of such foci (28,29).
