INFECTION AMONG HUMANS (PSITTACOSIS) Transmission\nBecause several diseases affecting humans can be caused by other species of Chlamydia, the disease resulting from the infection of humans with C. psittaci is referred to as psittacosis. Most C. psittaci infections in humans result from exposure to pet psittacine birds. However, transmission has been documented from free-ranging birds, including doves, pigeons, birds of prey, and shore birds. Infection with C. psittaci usually occurs when a person inhales the organism, which has been aerosolized from dried feces or respiratory secretions of infected birds. Other means of exposure include mouth-to-beak contact and the handling of infected birds' plumage and tissues. Even brief exposures can lead to symptomatic infection; therefore, some patients with psittacosis might not recall or report having any contact with birds.\nMammals occasionally transmit C. psittaci to humans. Certain strains of C. psittaci infect sheep, goats, and cattle, causing chronic infection of the reproductive tract, placental insufficiency, and abortion in these animals. These strains of C. psittaci are transmitted to persons when they are exposed to the birth fluids and placentas of infected animals.
