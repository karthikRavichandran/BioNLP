Death from water depletion will occur if 9-10 liters (18-20 pints) is lost from the body, and loss of 4 liters (8 pints) without replacement leads to intense thirst, a rapid heart rate, and a high body temperature. Water intake must equal the water loss by sweat if this disorder is to be avoided; workers exposed to hot climates must be encouraged to drink an ample supply of water or flavored drinks which must be readily available to them.
