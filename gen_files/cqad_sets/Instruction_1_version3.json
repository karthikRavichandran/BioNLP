Which of the following interventions would be most effective in reducing her risk of HIV exposure while she is seeking treatment?", "Choices": {"A": "Prescribing her a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for depression", "B": "Providing access to a syringe service program where she can obtain clean needles", "C": "Encouraging her to abstain completely from all drug use without supportive services", "D": "Referring her to an inpatient rehabilitation facility immediately"}, "Answer": "B: Providing access to a syringe service program where she can obtain clean needles. The best answer is B. Access to syringe service programs is crucial for individuals not yet in treatment. It reduces the risk of HIV transmission by providing sterile injection equipment, a significant preventive measure for individuals who inject drugs, especially those who are not currently seeking or able to access drug treatment services immediately."}, "actual_context": "Reducing or eliminating injection risk practices can be achieved by providing access to drug treatment and relapse prevention services (e.g., methadone, buprenorphine for opiate users) for persons who are willing to participate 125 . For persons not able (e.g., on a waiting list or lacking insurance) or not motivated to engage in drug treatment, providing access to unused injection equipment through syringe service programs (where available), prescriptions for syringes or purchase from pharmacies without a prescription (where legal) can reduce HIV exposure.

Key components may include both digital and paper-based systems that provide reminders, checklists, and feedback mechanisms, aiding clinicians which ultimately improve adherence to PrEP guidelines. Such systems can take the form of mobile applications, providing resources such as locations for HIV testing and tools for monitoring adherence, significantly benefiting patient education and follow-up care. Consistency with established federal guidelines on sexual health and antiretroviral medication use further supports the recommendations for PrEP therapy.", "Question": "A healthcare provider is exploring ways to improve patient adherence to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) therapy. Which of the following strategies would most effectively enhance protocol adherence and patient safety during PrEP treatment?", "Choices": {"A": "Encouraging patients to rely solely on verbal counseling without any written materials", "B": "Implementing decision support systems, including checklists and electronic reminders for patients", "C": "Focusing only on patient education about HIV without discussing medication adherence", "D": "Limiting follow-up contact to only initial consultations to avoid overwhelming patients"}, "Answer": {"Correct": "B: Implementing decision support systems, including checklists and electronic reminders for patients.", "Explanation": "The best answer is B. Decision support systems play a crucial role in assisting healthcare providers and patients in managing PrEP effectively. By employing tools such as reminders and checklists, providers can ensure that patients are more likely to adhere to their medication regimens, attend follow-up appointments, and receive comprehensive education about safe practices, thus enhancing patient safety and treatment outcomes."}}, "actual_context": "# Decision Support, Training and Technical Assistance\nDecision support systems (electronic and paper), flow sheets, checklists (see Clinical Providers' Supplement, Section 1 for a PrEP provider/patient checklist at ), feedback reminders, and involvement of nurse clinicians and pharmacists will be helpful in managing the many steps indicated for the safe use of PrEP and to increase the likelihood that patients will follow them. Often these systems are locally developed but may become available from various sources including training centers and Web sites funded by government agencies; professional associations, or interested private companies.
