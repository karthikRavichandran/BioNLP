The best answer is C. Chlamydia psittaci is the pathogen linked to psittacosis, which can be transmitted from infected birds to humans, particularly when humans are in close contact with these birds. The symptoms described in the patient align with those commonly seen in chlamydial infections resulting from exposure to infected avian species.", "B: Chlamydia psittaci. The best answer is B. This choice is correct as the patient's occupational exposure to birds, coupled with her symptoms, suggests psittacosis, which is specifically caused by Chlamydia psittaci. This bacterium is known to cause pneumonia in people who have been in contact with infected birds, and the patient's system is consistent with the infection's typical presentation.", "{'option': 'B', 'explanation': \"The best answer is B. Given the patient's occupation as a veterinarian, his recent exposure to sick birds, and his symptoms, the clinical presentation is most consistent with psittacosis, which is caused by C. psittaci. The organism is particularly associated with pneumonic presentations following bird exposure, especially pet psittacine birds.\"}", "A: Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. The correct answer is A. Considering the patient's exposure to birds and the presentation of pneumonia along with the indicated laboratory findings (thrombocytopenia), C. psittaci infection is highly suspected. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is included in the differential diagnosis as it can similarly present with atypical pneumonia symptoms, but is differentiated by its absence of bird exposure. The presence of plague endocarditis as a choice is misleading since the focus is on pneumonia and systemic features related to psittacosis rather than heart conditions.", "C: Complement fixation (CF) test for chlamydial antibodies. The best answer is C. The CF test is a serologic method used to detect chlamydial antibodies in patients suspected of having chlamydial infections, including psittacosis. Given the patient's clinical history of exposure to birds and respiratory symptoms, using the CF test can help establish the diagnosis. While PCR can be used for detection, the CF test is more specific for confirming chlamydial infections in this context.", "B: Avian psittacosis. The best answer is B. This diagnosis aligns with the clinical signs observed in the parrot, including lethargy, anorexia, discharge from the eyes and nose, and abnormal droppings. These symptoms are characteristic of avian chlamydiosis (psittacosis), caused by C. psittaci. The consideration of stress factors and the potential for the bird to appear healthy while shedding the organism reinforces this diagnosis.", "A: Administer analgesics and fluids, and prepare for surgery. The best answer is A. The initial management of acute cholecystitis involves stabilizing the patient with analgesics, fluid resuscitation, and then planning for surgical intervention, typically laparoscopic cholecystectomy, ideally within 24 to 48 hours of diagnosis.", "C: Wear an N95 respirator and wet the carcass with detergent and water before starting. The best answer is C. Performing necropsies on potentially infected birds requires stringent safety measures, including the use of a high-efficiency respirator like the N95 to prevent inhalation of infectious particles, and wetting the carcass to minimize the risk of aerosolization. Choices A, B, and D do not provide adequate protection against the risk of transmission of C. psittaci during the procedure.", "C: Transfer the sick bird to a different clean cage before cleaning its current cage. This is the correct answer because isolating the infected bird in a clean cage reduces the risk of spreading infection to healthy birds and allows for effective disinfection of the contaminated cage. It is important to take precautions during cleaning to prevent contamination from occurring. The other options would either increase the risk of spreading the infection or not effectively control the contamination process.", "C: Maintaining a high dietary concentration of calcium to boost immunity. The best answer is C. High dietary concentrations of calcium and other divalent cations inhibit the absorption of tetracyclines, which are likely used to treat avian chlamydiosis. Therefore, it is essential to avoid such dietary concentrations to ensure the treatment's effectiveness.", "B: Collect respiratory specimens for laboratory analysis. This is the correct answer because obtaining respiratory specimens is essential for definitive diagnosis of psittacosis, which is critical given the history of exposure to the bird. Early diagnosis influences treatment decisions and helps in reporting the case to health authorities.", "B: Treat the birds and isolate them in a separate area from the public for at least 7 days. This option is correct because it aligns with the guidelines for managing C. psittaci infection by ensuring that proper treatment is administered while preventing potential exposure to the public. Options A and C put other birds and people at risk and option D lacks a humane approach or consideration for treatment.", "C: Several birds exhibiting symptoms of respiratory illness were recently purchased from the same pet store. The best answer is C. When multiple suspect avian cases are identified from the same source, it triggers an epidemiologic investigation to track the source and prevent potential transmission to humans. This precaution is crucial in controlling outbreaks of diseases like psittacosis. Options A and B do not meet the criteria established for initiating an investigation, while D refers to outdated information that does not showcase current risk.", "C: Chromatic or immunologic staining of tissue-impression smears. The best answer is C because chromatic or immunologic staining is a specific diagnostic method used to identify organisms associated with avian chlamydiosis. The presence of cloudy air sacs and enlarged liver and spleen further supports the need for this specific testing to confirm the diagnosis of avian chlamydiosis.", "B: Collecting pooled samples from multiple birds over 3-5 consecutive days for culture. The best answer is B. This method is essential because C. psittaci may not be shed daily from infected birds, making it necessary to collect serial specimens over several days and pool them for culture. This approach increases the likelihood of detecting the organism and reduces costs associated with testing each individual sample.", "A: The Direct CF test is not sensitive enough for small psittacine birds, leading to higher chances of false-negative results.", "B: Perform a culture to verify if the bird is shedding the pathogen. This is the correct answer because even though the ELISA test gives a positive result, the absence of clinical signs indicates that further verification is necessary. In a clinically healthy bird with a positive ELISA, it is crucial to confirm the presence of the pathogen through isolation methods like culture to prevent unnecessary treatment based on potentially false-positive results.", "A: Gradually introduce the medicated feed by mixing it with their regular feed to enhance acceptance. The best approach is to blend the medicated feed with a familiar non-medicated diet to encourage the birds to accept the treatment diet. This method takes advantage of the birds' natural instinct to consume familiar flavors while gradually acclimating them to the medication. It avoids stress and potential harm associated with force feeding, and it allows for monitoring of their intake effectively.", "C: 40-50 mg/kg body weight once a day. The correct answer is C. According to the guidelines, Senegal parrots require a dosage of 40-50 mg/kg body weight administered orally once daily. This ensures effective treatment while minimizing potential side effects of the medication.", "B: Switch to a late-generation macrolide treatment after stabilization. The best answer is B. After the initial stabilization with oxytetracycline, it is crucial to switch to an alternative treatment to avoid muscle irritation caused by repeated injections. Late-generation macrolides are under investigation and offer a suitable option for ongoing treatment while minimizing complications.", "B: Euthanize the dog and submit its head for rabies examination. The best answer is B. To determine if rabies is a risk, the biting dog should be euthanized and its head submitted for examination. In cases where the vaccination status of the animal is unknown and it poses a potential rabies risk, immediate euthanasia and testing are warranted, especially given the aggressive behavior noted prior to the bite.", "C: Educate the public about avoiding contact with bats and their habitats. The best answer is C because while vaccination can be a useful strategy for managing rabies in wildlife, educating the public on avoiding contact with bats is a critical component of rabies prevention. Given that bats are common carriers of rabies and have caused human infections, public awareness and behavioral changes are essential to minimize encounters with potentially rabid bats.", "B: The effectiveness of rabies vaccination in wildlife has not been established, and no licensed vaccine exists for these animals. This answer is correct because the context specifies that the efficacy of rabies vaccinations in wildlife and hybrids is unknown and highlights that there are no licensed vaccines for these categories of animals. Therefore, using rabies vaccines meant for dogs and cats in wildlife would not be appropriate or guaranteed to work, highlighting the importance of following specific guidelines for animal vaccination.", "C: It compiles and disseminates data to inform public health policies and guide disease prevention efforts. The best answer is C. The MMWR's primary purpose is to collect, compile, and communicate health data from state health departments, which helps inform public health policies and enables quick responses to public health issues. This ongoing tracking of various health concerns allows for proactive disease prevention and intervention strategies.", "C: ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The best answer is C. The patient's presentation, including acute chest pain radiating to the arm and jaw, diaphoresis, elevated blood pressure, and ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, indicates an ST elevation myocardial infarction. STEMI is characterized by a full thickness myocardial injury and requires immediate medical intervention, unlike unstable angina or NSTEMI where there may not be ST elevation. Aortic dissection typically presents with different symptoms."]}
