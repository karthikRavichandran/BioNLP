However, since exposure occurs during aciylamide production and use, the potential for occupational exposure exists in all countries that produce or import acrylamide. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) estimates that more than 10,000 U.S. workers were potentially exposed to acrylamide monomer during the period 1981-83, either in acrylamide manufacturing and processing or in grouting operations (particularly in sewer grouting) . Other workers that are potentially exposed to variable and intermittent airborne concentrations and possible dermal contact with acrylamide are the researchers and technicians involved in the preparation of polyacrylamide   estimates that 100,000 to 200,000 of these U.S. workers have the potential for exposure.\nBecause acrylamide is produced by catalytic or sulfuric acid hydration of acrylonitrile (identified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer  as a probable human carcinogen ), acrylamide production workers may also be exposed to acrylonitrile.\nEvaluation of exposure data from industrial settings  indicates that in all four U.S. acrylamide production plants, airborne concentrations were generally below 0.3 mg/m3-the occupational exposure limit set by many countries (see the Appendix).\n                \n\n                Question : A factory worker has been employed in an acrylamide production plant for several years.

The current Swedish occupational exposure limit is 0.3 mg/m3 with a skin notation and a short-term exposure limit (STEL) of 0.9 mg/m3.

This reactivity and ease of transport may account for the toxic effects of acrylamide. Studies show that the toxicokinetics and tissue distribution of acrylamide are not significantly dependent on the dose and route of exposure.

Miller et al.  reported that high percentages of the wC-labeled chemical were found in muscle (48%), skin (15%), blood (12%), and liver (7%), whereas the neural tissues (brain, spinal cord, and sciatic nerve) contained less than 1%. However, when the data were expressed as micromoles (\u00bftmoles) of acrylamide/g of tissue, the concentrations of acrylamide in the tissues were similar. In the neural tissues of rats there appears to be no preferential bioconcentration of acrylamide and/or its metabolites that can account for its neurotoxic effects .\nAcrylamide has also been reported to distribute readily in the tissues of other animal species. For example, acrylamide was found in the blood, brain, heart, liver, kidneys, and lungs of miniature swine and beagle dogs, with the highest concentrations found in the liver and kidneys . Because the authors did not analyze skin, muscle, and other tissues, it is difficult to compare the results with those reported by Miller et al. .

Since no absorption phases were noted for the parent acrylamide in the liver and kidney, the increases in the 14C-labeled chemical in these two tissues were attributed to metabolite accumulation. The higher lipid content of the fat and testes and the polar nature of acrylamide were reported by Miller et al.  to have delayed the absorption in these two tissues. The initial portion (half-life of 5 hr) of the biphasic curve was attributed to the metabolism of acrylamide and the binding of its metabolites to biological macromolecules, since only 2% of the total dose of administered acrylamide was excreted as the parent compound. The terminal portion (half-life of 8 days) of the biphasic curve was thought to be the result of the release of acrylamide metabolites from tissue depots and the degradation of acrylamide-protein adducts .

This study was performed by scientists at major production plants. Mortality was tracked for a cohort of 8,854 males from 1925 to 1983. This cohort (2,293 of whom were exposed to acrylamide) consisted of four plant populations in the United States and the Netherlands. Followup was completed for 95% of the cohort. At the end of the study 2,148 individuals were deceased, and death certificates were obtained for 95%. The underlying cause of death was coded by a nosologist. Exposure estimates were developed for all jobs at each of the four plants using exposure data collected at each plant and information obtained from plant personnel who had knowledge of past jobs and processes. Exposure to acrylamide was defined as a cumulative exposure greater than 0.001 mg/m3-years, which is approximately equivalent to a 1-day exposure to an average concentration of 0.3 mg/m3. Data on smoking history were available for only a third of the cohort. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and internally standardized rate ratios were employed to estimate the risk.\nAccording to the authors, a particular strength of their study was the ability to detect a 25% increase in total cancer, a 50% increase in respiratory cancer, and a threefold increase in brain and other central nervous system cancers based on a two-tailed, 5% significance level with a power of 80%.\n                \n\n                Question : What was a key strength of the study conducted by Collins et al. regarding the assessment of cancer risk among workers exposed to acrylamide?\n                \n\n                Choices : ['A: The study included a large representative sample of both exposed and unexposed workers.', 'B: The study utilized advanced imaging techniques to diagnose cancer in participants.', 'C: The study ability to detect significant increases in various types of cancer with specified power and significance levels.', \"D: The study's exclusion of participants with a history of smoking to minimize confounding variables.\"]\n                \n\n                Output : <opt>Selected option - Just option char or number<\\opt>\n                \n\n            Note: give the final answer as the option and don't provide the full choice\n            ", "orginal_ans": "C: The study ability to detect significant increases in various types of cancer with specified power and significance levels.

Exposure to acrylamide was categorized on the basis of a review of job classifications. Before 1957, personal TWA exposures to acrylamide in the monomer production areas were 0.1 to 1.0 mg/m3. The data from 1957 to 1970 indicated that exposures to acrylamide were 0.1 to 0.6 mg/m3. After 1970, personal exposures to acrylamide were <0.1 mg/m3 for all job classifications. Associated with the production of acrylamide monomer is the potential for exposure to acrylonitrile. The possible confounding effect of this exposure was not formally addressed in this study; but in a previous epidemiologic study , no effects could be directly related to acrylonitrile under the conditions of exposure. The total number of deaths from malignancies was slightly elevated (11 observed versus 7.9 expected ), but this result was apparently due to the excess in a subgroup that was also exposed to organic dyes . Overall, the results did not indicate an excess of cancers from exposures to acrylamide. However, these results may be due to the small cohort size, limited followup, and short duration of exposure (274 workers were exposed for less than 5 years).

Miller et al.  found that the concentration o f 14C in whole blood reached a plateau at 12% o f the total dose after 1 hr and remained constant throughout the time period examined (7 days). The binding to erythrocytes accounted for essentially all o f the remaining radioactivity in the w hole blood.
