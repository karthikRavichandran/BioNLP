Travelers can acquire plague in one area and become ill in another area where plague is not endemic (i.e., peripatetic plague) (3)(4)(5)(6)(7). Although rare, peripatetic plague is more likely to result in fatal outcomes because of delays in seeking treatment or misdiagnosis in areas where health-care providers might be less familiar with the disease (3)(4)(5)(6)(7). In the current state of heightened awareness of possible terrorism, peripatetic cases also might be confused with those arising from an intentional release of plague bacteria. The two cases described in this report did not cause such confusion because the initial history provided a plausible exposure. In addition, both patients had inguinal adenopathy, indicating that transmission was from bites of infectious fleas rather than inhalation of airborne materials, the route considered more likely for terrorism (8). However, intentional release should be considered as a cause of cases occurring outside an area where plague is endemic, particularly for patients with primary pneumonic or primary septicemic plague.\n                \n\n                Question : What is the most appropriate public health measure to prevent the transmission of plague in this man's environment?\n                \n\n                Choices : {'A': 'Promoting the use of repellents to prevent mosquito bites', 'B': 'Educating the public on safe methods to handle rodents', 'C': 'Implementing rodent-proof buildings in the camping area', 'D': 'Advising against hiking in any rural areas'}\n                \n\n                Output : <opt>Selected option - Just option char or number<\\opt>\n                \n\n            Note: give the final answer as the option and don't provide the full choice\n            ", "orginal_ans": "C: Implementing rodent-proof buildings in the camping area.

Because travel often was difficult and dangerous, Coalition forces received numerous requests from hospital directors for armed security, and many healthcare workers reportedly feared either to commute to their worksites or to remain after dark (D. Simpson, M.D., Coalition Provisional Authority 's Ministry of Health Team, personal correspondence, 2003). Public health employees who were able to continue their work went unpaid for several weeks. As a result, throughout Iraq, core public health services (e.g., vaccination services, vectorborne disease control, and the Tuberculosis Directly Observed Therapy program) were disrupted. In addition, severe health hazards caused by damaged water and sanitation systems were added to an already compromised and deteriorating health-care system (1,2).
