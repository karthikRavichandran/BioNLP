Travelers can acquire plague in one area and become ill in another area where plague is not endemic (i.e., peripatetic plague) (3)(4)(5)(6)(7). Although rare, peripatetic plague is more likely to result in fatal outcomes because of delays in seeking treatment or misdiagnosis in areas where health-care providers might be less familiar with the disease (3)(4)(5)(6)(7). In the current state of heightened awareness of possible terrorism, peripatetic cases also might be confused with those arising from an intentional release of plague bacteria. The two cases described in this report did not cause such confusion because the initial history provided a plausible exposure.

Basic communications were disrupted nationally. Public health headquarters, clinics, and laboratories were damaged, records were ruined, and equipment was stolen. Because travel often was difficult and dangerous, Coalition forces received numerous requests from hospital directors for armed security, and many healthcare workers reportedly feared either to commute to their worksites or to remain after dark (D. Simpson, M.D., Coalition Provisional Authority 's Ministry of Health Team, personal correspondence, 2003). Public health employees who were able to continue their work went unpaid for several weeks. As a result, throughout Iraq, core public health services (e.g., vaccination services, vectorborne disease control, and the Tuberculosis Directly Observed Therapy program) were disrupted. In addition, severe health hazards caused by damaged water and sanitation systems were added to an already compromised and deteriorating health-care system (1,2). This report assesses the cumulative impact of these conditions on vaccination services in postwar Iraq, including the subsequent loss of staff, facilities, and equipment.
