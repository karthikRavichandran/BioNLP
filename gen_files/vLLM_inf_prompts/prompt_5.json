The criteria and standard will be subject to review and revision as necessary.\n\"Inorganic lead\" means lead oxides, metallic lead, and lead salts (Including organic salts such as lead soaps but excluding lead arsenate). \"Exposure to Inorganic lead\" is defined as exposure above half the recommended workroom environmental standard.
