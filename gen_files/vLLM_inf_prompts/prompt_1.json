In a randomized placebo-controlled trial, perinatal transmission was reduced 68% among the HIV-infected women who received zidovudine during pregnancy and labor and whose infants received zidovudine for 6 weeks after birth 13 . That is, these infants received both preexposure and postexposure prophylaxis. In 1995, investigators used case-control surveillance data from health-care workers to demonstrate that zidovudine provided within 72 hours after percutaneous exposure to HIV-infected blood and continued for 28 days (PEP, or postexposure prophylaxis) was associated with an 81% reduction in the risk of acquiring HIV infection  .\nEvidence from these human studies of blood-borne and perinatal transmission as well as studies of vaginal and rectal exposure among animals  suggested that PrEP (using antiretroviral drugs) could reduce the risk of acquiring HIV infection from sexual and drug-use exposures. Clinical trials were launched to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PrEP in populations at risk of HIV infection through several routes of exposure.
