The influenza A(H3N2) and B antigens differ from the respective 2010-11 and 2011-12 seasonal vaccine antigens (3). The influenza A(H1N1) vaccine virus strain is derived from an influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (2009) virus and was included in the 2009(H1N1) monovalent pandemic vaccine as well as the 2010-11 and 2011-12 seasonal vaccines.\n\n# Recommendations for Vaccination\nRoutine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged \u22656 months.

Several studies have indicated that the time interval between two initial doses (from 4 weeks up to 1 year) of the same antigen might not be critical (7)(8)(9). However, because of the antigenic novelty of the 2009(H1N1) pandemic virus, which is anticipated to continue circulating during 2012-13, exposure history to this antigen also must be considered. Children who last received seasonal (trivalent) influenza vaccine before the 2010-11 season but did not receive a vaccine containing 2009(H1N1) antigen (either seasonal vaccine since July 2010 or monovalent 2009 vaccine) will not have received this antigen. These children are recommended to receive 2 doses this season, even if 2 doses of seasonal influenza vaccine were received before the 2010-11 season. This is illustrated in two approaches for determining the number of doses required for children aged 6 months through 8 years, both of which are acceptable (Figure 1). 1.

All currently available influenza vaccines are prepared by means of inoculation of virus into chicken eggs. The use of influenza vaccines for persons with a history of egg allergy has been reviewed recently by ACIP (16). For the 2011-12 influenza season, ACIP recommended that persons with egg allergy who report only hives after egg exposure should receive TIV, with several additional safety measures, as described in this document. Recent examination of VAERS data indicated no disproportionate reporting of allergy or anaphylaxis after influenza vaccination during the 2011-12 season (21). For the 2012-13 influenza season, ACIP recommends the following: 1. Persons with a history of egg allergy who have experienced only hives after exposure to egg should receive influenza vaccine, with the following additional safety measures (Figure 2): a) Because studies published to date involved use of TIV, TIV rather than LAIV should be used ( 22); b) Vaccine should be administered by a health-care provider who is familiar with the potential manifestations of egg allergy; and c) Vaccine recipients should be observed for at least 30 minutes for signs of a reaction after administration of each vaccine dose (22). Other measures, such as dividing and administering the vaccine by a two-step approach and skin testing with vaccine, are not necessary (22). 2.\n                \n\n                Question : A 25-year-old woman with a history of hives after eating eggs is due for her annual influenza vaccination.

Those who are able to eat lightly cooked egg (e.g., scrambled egg) without reaction are unlikely to be allergic. Egg-allergic persons might tolerate egg in baked products (e.g., bread or cake). Tolerance to egg-containing foods does not exclude the possibility of egg allergy (23).
