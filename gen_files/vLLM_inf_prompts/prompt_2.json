In humans, the resulting infection is referred to as psittacosis (also known as parrot fever and ornithosis). Psittacosis typically causes influenza-like symptoms and can lead to severe pneumonia and nonrespiratory health problems. With appropriate treatment, the disease is rarely fatal. From 1988 through 1998, CDC received reports of 813 cases of psittacosis (1 ), which is an underrepresentation of the actual number of cases because psittacosis is difficult to diagnose and cases often go unreported. During the 1980s, approximately 70% of the psittacosis cases with a known source of infection resulted from exposure to pet birds. The largest group affected (43%) included bird fanciers and owners of pet birds. Pet shop employees accounted for an additional 10% of cases. Other persons at risk include pigeon fanciers and persons whose occupation places them at risk for exposure (e.g., employees in poultry slaughtering and processing plants, veterinarians, veterinary technicians, laboratory workers, workers in avian quarantine stations, farmers, wildlife rehabilitators, and zoo workers). Because human infection can result from brief, passing exposure to infected birds or their contaminated droppings, persons with no identified leisure-time or occupational risk can become infected.\n                \n\n                Question : What is the most likely causative agent of the patient's illness?\n                \n\n                Choices : ['Mycoplasma pneumoniae', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Chlamydia psittaci', 'Legionella pneumophila']\n                \n\n                Output : <opt>Selected option - Just option char or number<\\opt>\n                \n\n            Note: give the final answer as the option and don't provide the full choice\n            ", "orginal_ans": "C: Chlamydia psittaci.

INFECTION AMONG HUMANS (PSITTACOSIS) Transmission\nBecause several diseases affecting humans can be caused by other species of Chlamydia, the disease resulting from the infection of humans with C. psittaci is referred to as psittacosis. Most C. psittaci infections in humans result from exposure to pet psittacine birds. However, transmission has been documented from free-ranging birds, including doves, pigeons, birds of prey, and shore birds. Infection with C. psittaci usually occurs when a person inhales the organism, which has been aerosolized from dried feces or respiratory secretions of infected birds. Other means of exposure include mouth-to-beak contact and the handling of infected birds' plumage and tissues. Even brief exposures can lead to symptomatic infection; therefore, some patients with psittacosis might not recall or report having any contact with birds.\nMammals occasionally transmit C. psittaci to humans. Certain strains of C. psittaci infect sheep, goats, and cattle, causing chronic infection of the reproductive tract, placental insufficiency, and abortion in these animals. These strains of C. psittaci are transmitted to persons when they are exposed to the birth fluids and placentas of infected animals. Another strain of C. psittaci, feline keratoconjunctivitis agent, typically causes rhinitis and conjunctivitis in cats. Transmission of this strain from cats to humans rarely occurs.\n                \n\n                Question : Which of the following precautions could have prevented the death of the baby?\n                \n\n                Choices : ['Using a weighted blanket to keep the baby warm during sleep', 'Placing the baby in a prone position to prevent choking', 'Co-sleeping in the same bed with parents to monitor the baby closely', 'Placing the infant in a supine position on a firm mattress while sleeping']\n                \n\n                Output : <opt>Selected option - Just option char or number<\\opt>\n                \n\n            Note: give the final answer as the option and don't provide the full choice\n            ", "orginal_ans": "D: Placing the infant in a supine position on a firm mattress while sleeping.

Acute-phase serum specimens should be obtained as soon as possible after onset of symptoms, and convalescent-phase serum specimens should be obtained 2 weeks after onset of symptoms. Because antibiotic treatment can delay or diminish the antibody response, a third serum sample might help confirm the diagnosis. All sera should be tested simultaneously at the same laboratory. If the patient's epidemiologic and clinical history indicate a possible diagnosis of psittacosis, MIF and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays can be used to distinguish C. psittaci infection from infection with other chlamydial species.

Signs of AC include lethargy, anorexia, and ruffled feathers, similar to signs of other systemic illnesses.

These problems reduce the effectiveness of treatment and promote the development of secondary infections with other bacteria or yeast.\n- Observe the birds daily, and weigh them every 3-7 days. If the birds are not maintaining weight, have them reevaluated by a veterinarian.\n- Avoid high dietary concentrations of calcium and other divalent cations because they inhibit the absorption of tetracyclines. Remove oyster shell, mineral blocks, and cuttlebone.\n- Isolate birds that are to be treated in clean, uncrowded cages.\n- Clean up all spilled food promptly; wash food and water containers daily.\n- Provide fresh water and appropriate vitamins daily.\n                \n\n                Question : What is the most critical intervention the veterinarian should implement to prevent the spread of the suspected infection?\n                \n\n                Choices : ['A: Administer vaccinations to all birds in the sanctuary to prevent potential infections.', 'B: Isolate suspected infected birds and ensure proper cleaning and sanitization of the aviary.', 'C: Increase the intake of calcium supplements in the diet of all birds to boost their immunity.', 'D: Provide additional food and water without any cleaning of existing supplies or cages.']\n                \n\n                Output : <opt>Selected option - Just option char or number<\\opt>\n                \n\n            Note: give the final answer as the option and don't provide the full choice\n            ", "orginal_ans": "B: Isolate suspected infected birds and ensure proper cleaning and sanitization of the aviary.

False-negative results can occur if insufficient antigen is present. As with all nonculture tests, the results must be evaluated in conjunction with clinical findings.

The best initial management step for this child is oral rehydration therapy (ORT). Given that the child is exhibiting mild signs of dehydration due to gastroenteritis, ORT is recommended to replenish fluids and electrolytes lost through diarrhea and vomiting. It is effective and should be attempted before considering IV fluids unless the child is unable to tolerate oral intake or has severe dehydration. Intravenous therapy may be needed later if oral rehydration fails or the child's condition worsens. Antibiotics are not indicated in viral gastroenteritis, and antiemetic medication is not the priority at this stage."}]
