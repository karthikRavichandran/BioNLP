Principles in this manual adapt (1) writings of classical rhetoricians; (2) a wealth of modern crisis, issues management, communication theory, and psychological theory; and (3) lessons learned from the real and often painful world of experience, old-fashioned trial and error. CERC addresses a number of topics critical to successful public, partner, and stakeholder communication during crises and emergencies. This is not intended to be an in-depth manual on risk communication, issues management, crisis communication, or disaster communication. It is an amalgamation of all of these, incorporated from theory and practical applications. CERC draws on the work of many experts including Drs. Peter Sandman and Vincent Covello; therefore, no single chapter is a complete source for a specific discipline. The chapters are meant to help those who are charged with these responsibilities, but who may not be steeped in these subjects, to manage the task of planning and implementing CERC activities. When possible, we have provided resource sites that offer more in-depth materials on a particular subject. CERC is the attempt by public health professionals to provide information that allows individuals, stakeholders, and entire communities to make the best possible decisions for their well-being during a crisis or emergency.

When it was written, the central role of crisis communication in public health responses to crises was beginning to be recognized. Since that time, thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of health, emergency management, and government professionals have been trained using the original CERC Manual and associated materials in the United States, Canada, Europe, and many other locations.\nWhile CERC principles are timeless, new information has been developed, new examples have emerged, and new understandings have been created.

Be First: Crises are time-sensitive. Communicating information quickly is almost always important. For members of the public, the first source of information often becomes the preferred source.\n2. Be Right: Accuracy establishes credibility. Information can include what is known, what is not known, and what is being done to fill in the gaps.\n3. Be Credible: Honesty and truthfulness should not be compromised during crises.\n4. Express Empathy: Crises create harm, and the suffering should be acknowledged in words.\nAddressing what people are feeling, and the challenges they face, builds trust and rapport.\n5. Promote Action: Giving people meaningful things to do calms anxiety, helps restore order, and promotes a restored sense of control.\n6. Show Respect: Respectful communication is particularly important when people feel vulnerable.

Listed are just a few events over the last 60 years that demonstrate that infections are here to stay:\nAs early as the 1950s, penicillin began losing its ability to cure Staphylococcus aureus infections, also known as staph. 12 In the 1970s, there was a resurgence of sexually transmitted diseases. 12 Also during the 1970s, new diseases were identified, such as Legionnaires' disease, toxic shock syndrome, and Ebola. 12 At the same time, antibiotic-resistant bacteria became more common in hospitals, spreading to patients and into communities. 12,13 In 1981, AIDS was first reported by CDC. 14 Flu season remains a yearly threat. Experts say it is possible that a new pandemic strain might emerge that could span the globe and reduce the world's population. 15 In 1997, the avian influenza, H5N1, scare in Hong Kong raised the specter of a possible global pandemic and jolted the world. 16 The emergence of H1N1 in 2009 was yet another sign that a deadly pandemic is possible. 16\n                \n\n                Question : Which of the following factors is primarily responsible for the resurgence of infectious diseases and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria since the mid-20th century?\n                \n\n                Choices : {'A': 'Increased vaccinations for childhood diseases', 'B': 'Overuse and misuse of antibiotics', 'C': 'Global travel and trade restrictions', 'D': 'Rapid advancements in biotechnology'}\n                \n\n                Output : <opt>Selected option - Just option char or number<\\opt>\n                \n\n            Note: give the final answer as the option and don't provide the full choice\n            ", "orginal_ans": "B: Overuse and misuse of antibiotics.

This answer is correct because CERC specifically emphasizes the need for rapid decision-making in emergencies where complete information may not be available. Unlike traditional risk communication, which may allow for more comprehensive assessment and deliberation, CERC recognizes that the time constraints of crises necessitate swift actions based on the best available but possibly incomplete information."}, {"prompt": "Answer the medical question based on the below options provided\n            \n\n            Question : What is the primary purpose of the National Incident Management System (NIMS) in the context of emergency management?\n            \n\n            Choices : {'A': 'To establish a centralized command for all crisis management operations', 'B': 'To enhance communication and coordination among responding agencies during incidents', 'C': 'To provide funding for local emergency services and first responders', 'D': 'To create a national standardized testing program for emergency responders'}\n            \n\n            Output : <opt>Selected option<\\opt>\n            \n\n        Note: give the final answer as the option and don't provide the full choice\n        ", "context_prompt": "Answer the medical question based on the below options provided and the context\n                \n\n                Context : # Businesses\nIt is important to remember that at the center of any crisis are those individuals, groups, and communities most directly affected. All disasters are local. The community is the first and most important responder.\nThe role of government agencies is outlined by a set of federal guidelines called the National Incident Management System (NIMS). 20 NIMS is a national standard for organizing agencies and improving coordination of incident management operations. Communication is a key part of NIMS. It applies to creating systems where agencies can communicate with each other, what is called interoperability. It also ensures that good communication occurs with the public.\n\"Numerous after-action reports from major incidents throughout the history of emergency management in our nation have cited communications difficulties among the many responding agencies as a major failing and challenge to policymakers.\"\nThe National Emergency Communications Plan\nThe Communication Lifecycle\n                \n\n                Question : What is the primary purpose of the National Incident Management System (NIMS) in the context of emergency management?\n                \n\n                Choices : {'A': 'To establish a centralized command for all crisis management operations', 'B': 'To enhance communication and coordination among responding agencies during incidents', 'C': 'To provide funding for local emergency services and first responders', 'D': 'To create a national standardized testing program for emergency responders'}\n                \n\n                Output : <opt>Selected option - Just option char or number<\\opt>\n                \n\n            Note: give the final answer as the option and don't provide the full choice\n            ", "orginal_ans": "B: To enhance communication and coordination among responding agencies during incidents.
