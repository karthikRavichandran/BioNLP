During 1995 and 1996, health departments and poison-control centers in New York City (NYC); Newark, New Jersey; Philadelphia; and Baltimore reported at least 325 cases of drug overdoses requiring medical treatment in persons who had used \"street drugs\" sold as heroin that probably also contained scopolamine, an anticholinergic drug. This report summarizes the clinical and epidemiologic features of these cases, which represent a new type of drug overdose.On March 16, 1995, eight persons were treated in the emergency department (ED) of a Bronx hospital for acute onset of agitation and hallucinations approximately 1 hour after \"snorting\" heroin. On physical examination, all these persons had clinical manifestations of anticholinergic toxicity (i.e., tachycardia, mild hypertension, dilated pupils, dry skin and mucous membranes, and diminished or absent bowel sounds); five had urinary retention. All were initially lethargic and became agitated and combative after emergency medical service (EMS) personnel treated them with parenteral naloxone, which is routinely used for suspected heroin overdose to reverse the toxic effects of opioids (e.g., coma and respiratory depression).

During 1985-1994, the percentage of firearm-related homicides among all homicides in the total population increased from 60% to 72% and among persons aged 15-24 years, from 67% to 87% (3 ). These increases illustrate that changes in overall homicide rates primarily reflect changes in firearm-related homicides. The stabilization of firearm-related homicide rates during 1992-1994-particularly among those aged 15-24 years-reflects a change from the increasing rates in previous years, even though rates remain at record-high levels. The findings in this report also indicate the usefulness of CMS data as a source of information for monitoring homicide in the United States.

For skin exposures without increased risk, the risk for drug toxicity outweighs the benefit of PEP.\n                \n\n                Question : A nurse is assessing the risk factors for HIV transmission in a patient who reports a needle-stick injury. The injury occurred when the nurse was handling a syringe that had been used on an HIV-positive patient. The nurse learns that the syringe had been capped and sealed prior to the injury. Which of the following best describes the level of risk for HIV transmission in this scenario compared to a situation where the syringe was uncapped and actively leaking blood?\n                \n\n                Choices : {'A': 'The risk is significantly higher with a capped syringe', 'B': 'The risk of transmission is equivalent regardless of the syringe status', 'C': 'The risk is negligible since the syringe was capped', 'D': 'The risk is moderately lower with a capped syringe'}\n                \n\n                Output : <opt>Selected option - Just option char or number<\\opt>\n                \n\n            Note: give the final answer as the option and don't provide the full choice\n            ", "orginal_ans": "C: The risk is negligible since the syringe was capped. In this scenario, the capped syringe that had been handled reduces the risk of HIV transmission significantly. By contrast, if the syringe were uncapped and actively leaking blood, the risk would be much higher due to direct exposure to the fluid. Thus, the precaution of capping the syringe before handling helps protect the healthcare worker from potential HIV exposure."}, {"prompt": "Answer the medical question based on the below options provided\n            \n\n            Question : Which of the following individuals is most likely to be involved in the production of the MMWR, contributing vital epidemiological data to public health decision-making?\n            \n\n            Choices : {'A': 'A private practice pediatrician focusing solely on patient care', 'B': 'An infectious disease epidemiologist analyzing outbreak trends in populations', 'C': 'A medical textbook author writing about historical diseases', 'D': 'A radiologic technician performing imaging studies in a hospital'}\n            \n\n            Output : <opt>Selected option<\\opt>\n            \n\n        Note: give the final answer as the option and don't provide the full choice\n        ", "context_prompt": "Answer the medical question based on the below options provided and the context\n                \n\n                Context : # Contributors to the Production of the MMWR (Weekly)\nWeekly\n                \n\n                Question : Which of the following individuals is most likely to be involved in the production of the MMWR, contributing vital epidemiological data to public health decision-making?\n                \n\n                Choices : {'A': 'A private practice pediatrician focusing solely on patient care', 'B': 'An infectious disease epidemiologist analyzing outbreak trends in populations', 'C': 'A medical textbook author writing about historical diseases', 'D': 'A radiologic technician performing imaging studies in a hospital'}\n                \n\n                Output : <opt>Selected option - Just option char or number<\\opt>\n                \n\n            Note: give the final answer as the option and don't provide the full choice\n            ", "orginal_ans": "B: An infectious disease epidemiologist analyzing outbreak trends in populations.
